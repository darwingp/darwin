# push307

Evolves a program to compute a symbolic regression. This was implemented for Hamilton College's CS 307: Genetic Programming class. This is the work of Jack Hay and Nate Symer.

## Usage

There are two ways to run the main PushGP function:

1. Load `core.clj` into the interpreter, and then run `(-main)`.
2. From the command line, run `lein run`.
