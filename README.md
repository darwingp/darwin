# push307

Evolves a program to compute a symbolic regression. This was implemented for Hamilton College's CS 307: Genetic Programming class. This is the work of Jack Hay and Nate Symer.

## Usage

There are two ways to run the main PushGP function:

1. Load `core.clj` into the interpreter, and then run `(-main)`.
2. From the command line, run `lein run`.

## Idea for Expansion

Car driver
  - Avoid obstacles
  - Continue after crashes

## TODO

### For Monday

- [ ] Make it work

### Future Plans (after monday)

- [ ] Make decisions on things like error/fitness
- [ ] Push interpreter nested
- [ ] More instructions
- [ ] Measure Structural Diversity
- [ ] Plush Genome

### Other

- [ ] Implement CI pipeline strategy
- [ ] Trace system for maintaining diversity
