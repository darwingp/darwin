# push307

This is the template for a PushGP system for Hamilton's CS 307: Genetic Programming class.

If you choose to make a fork of this to version control your code (which would be a good idea!) please make it private as to not share code with your classmates. Student GitHub users should be able to get free private repositories.

## Usage

There are two ways to run the main PushGP function:

1. Load `core.clj` into the interpreter, and then run `(-main)`.
2. From the command line, run `lein run`.
