;NOTES:
;-------------------
; Testing alternation crossover 1000 times with prog sizes of 30,
;0.2 alternation rate, 4 alignment deviation yielded an average size of 48.
; Code:
; (/ (reduce + (repeatedly 10000 #(count (alternation-crossover (range 40) (range 40) 0.2 4)))) 10000)
; This dropped to 45 with 0.3, 3
; I will test it more to see how we can mitigate bloat...
